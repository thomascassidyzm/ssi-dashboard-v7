Welcome to this unusual game that will help you to become an Italian speaker. Here's how it works - I teach you something in Italian, then I say something in English and give you a chance to say it out loud in Italian. Then, you listen carefully to the Italian speakers who will model it for you. It's important that you say something in the gaps, because that's how you learn. Even if you aren't sure, have a go at saying whatever you can, and you'll be starting to speak in Italian sooner than you think. The more you treat it as a game, the more playful you are with it, the more you laugh when you make mistakes, the better it will go and the faster you will learn. So, let's start playing.
