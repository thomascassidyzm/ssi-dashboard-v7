# Pattern Identification Methodology

## The Core Insight

**Pattern = INVARIANT structure**
**Vocabulary = VARIANT content**

Learners need to see: "Ah! This is the SAME PATTERN, just with DIFFERENT WORDS!"

---

## What IS a Pattern?

A **pattern** is a grammatical or structural template where:
- The STRUCTURE stays constant
- The CONTENT varies

**Example (Spanish P01):**
```
PATTERN: [Subject] + quiero + [INFINITIVE]

INSTANCES:
- Yo quiero hablar    (I want to speak)
- Yo quiero aprender  (I want to learn)
- Yo quiero intentar  (I want to try)

INVARIANT: "quiero + infinitive"
VARIANT: which infinitive (hablar, aprender, intentar)
```

The learner recognizes: "Oh! 'Quiero' + any verb = 'I want to [do that verb]'"

---

## When IS It a Pattern?

### Test 1: **Slot Substitutability**

Can you swap vocabulary without changing the structure?

✅ **YES = It's a pattern**
```
Quiero hablar
Quiero aprender  ← swap verb, structure unchanged
Quiero practicar
```

❌ **NO = It's not a pattern** (or it's a different pattern)
```
Quiero hablar
Hablo bien       ← changed structure, not same pattern
```

### Test 2: **Multiple Instances Exist**

Will this structure appear with different vocabulary at least 3+ times in the course?

✅ **YES = Worth identifying as pattern**
- Teaches reusable structure
- High pedagogical ROI

❌ **NO = Don't pattern-mark it**
- One-off construction
- Low ROI, adds cognitive load

### Test 3: **Learner Recognition**

Would a learner say: "I've seen this structure before!"?

✅ **YES = Good pattern**
```
Estoy intentando aprender (I'm trying to learn)
Estoy intentando recordar (I'm trying to remember)
→ Learner: "Oh! Estoy + -ando/-iendo = I'm [verb]-ing"
```

❌ **NO = Too vague or too specific**
```
"Using articles" ← Too vague
"The whole sentence" ← Too specific
```

---

## Pattern Identification Process

### STEP 1: Find Structural Repetition

As you extract seeds, ask:
- "Have I seen this grammatical structure before?"
- "Does it have a slot where vocabulary changes?"

**Example Analysis:**
```
S0001: Quiero hablar     (I want to speak)
S0007: Quiero intentar   (I want to try)
→ PATTERN DETECTED: Quiero + infinitive
```

### STEP 2: Define the Invariant

What stays the SAME across all instances?

**Format: [Fixed Element] + [Slot Type]**

✅ Good pattern definitions:
- "Quiero + infinitive"
- "Estoy + gerund"
- "Voy a + infinitive"
- "Verb + 得 + complement" (Chinese)

❌ Bad pattern definitions:
- "Using quiero" ← What comes after?
- "Want pattern" ← Not language-specific enough
- "First person constructions" ← Too broad

### STEP 3: Name by Parent Seed

Pattern gets its name from the FIRST seed where it appears:

```
S0001 introduces: P01 = "Quiero + infinitive"
S0002 introduces: P02 = "Estoy + gerund"
S0005 introduces: P03 = "Voy a + infinitive"
```

Why? Provenance tracking + de-duplication during parallel extraction.

### STEP 4: Write Learner-Facing Description

How would you explain this to a learner in ONE sentence?

✅ Good descriptions:
- "Use 'quiero' + any verb to say 'I want to [do that thing]'"
- "Add -ing to verb after 'estoy' to say 'I'm [verb]-ing'"
- "Put 'voy a' before verb to say 'I'm going to [do it]'"

❌ Bad descriptions:
- "Modal auxiliary with infinitive complement" ← Too technical
- "Want construction" ← Too vague
- "P01 pattern" ← Meaningless to learner

## Pattern Taxonomy

### Category 1: Verb Phrase Patterns

**Structure: [Auxiliary/Modal] + [Verb Form]**

Examples:
- P01 (Spanish): Quiero + infinitive
- P02 (Spanish): Estoy + gerund
- P03 (Spanish): Voy a + infinitive
- P04 (Spanish): Me gustaría + infinitive
- P17 (Spanish): Necesito + infinitive
- P18 (Spanish): Puedo + infinitive

**Why these are patterns:**
- Same structure, different main verb
- High frequency (appear 50+ times in course)
- Learners need to generate many instances

### Category 2: Tense/Aspect Patterns

**Structure: [Conjugation Type] applied to verbs**

Examples:
- P05 (Spanish): Simple present (hablo, hablas, habla...)
- P13 (Spanish): Imperfect (hablaba, aprendía...)
- P15 (Spanish): Preterite (hablé, aprendí...)
- P16 (Spanish): Past progressive (estaba + gerund)

**Why these are patterns:**
- Same conjugation paradigm, different verbs
- Generative: learner can apply to ANY verb
- Core grammar structures

### Category 3: Subordinate Clause Patterns

**Structure: [Main clause] + [Connector] + [Subordinate clause]**

Examples:
- P10 (Spanish): Subjunctive clauses (después de que + subjunctive)
- Temporal clauses: antes de que, cuando, mientras
- Relative clauses: que + verb

**Why these are patterns:**
- Predictable structure across different content
- Shows language-specific clause linkage
- Different from English (pedagogical value)

### Category 4: Question Patterns

**Structure: [Question word] + [Clause structure]**

Examples:
- P12 (Spanish): ¿Cómo...? / ¿Por qué...? / ¿Cuándo...?
- Question words + corresponding structures

**Why these are patterns:**
- Reusable question formation
- Works with any vocabulary
- Essential communication function

### Category 5: Impersonal/Fixed Constructions

**Structure: [Fixed phrase] + [Variable complement]**

Examples:
- P06 (Spanish): No estoy seguro (si...)
- P20 (Spanish): Es útil / Es importante / Es necesario + infinitive

**Why these are patterns:**
- Fixed frame, variable content
- High-utility expressions
- Appear frequently

### Category 6: Language-Specific Structural Patterns

**Structure: Constructions unique to target language**

Examples (Spanish):
- P14: Duration with llevar (Llevo + gerund + time)
- Gustar-like verbs (Me gusta, Me importa, Me parece)

Examples (Chinese):
- P07: Verb + 得 + complement (degree of result)
- P11: Relative clauses with 的 (verb phrase + 的 + noun)

**Why these are patterns:**
- No direct English equivalent
- Requires pattern recognition (not word-for-word)
- High pedagogical value (learners need explicit instruction)

---

## Anti-Patterns: What's NOT a Pattern?

### ❌ Too Specific

"The construction used in sentence S0023"
- Not reusable
- No generative power

### ❌ Too Vague

"Using verbs in Spanish"
- No structural definition
- Can't practice systematically

### ❌ One-Off Constructions

Phrases that appear only once or twice:
- Low ROI for pattern-marking
- Better taught as fixed expressions

### ❌ Lexical Sets (Not Structural)

"Days of the week" / "Colors" / "Numbers"
- Vocabulary lists, not grammatical patterns
- Different pedagogical category

## Pattern Marking in Extraction

### When Extracting a LEGO:

**If LEGO demonstrates a pattern:**
```json
{
  "id": "S0001L01",
  "lego": ["I want", "Quiero"],
  "type": "C",
  "pattern_demonstrated": "P01",
  "note": "First person want - establishes P01 pattern"
}
```

**If LEGO uses pattern (but doesn't introduce it):**
```json
{
  "id": "S0007L01",
  "lego": ["I want", "Quiero"],
  "type": "C",
  "pattern_demonstrated": "P01",
  "note": "Reinforces P01 with different infinitive"
}
```

**At seed level:**
```json
{
  "S0001": {
    "patterns_used": ["P01"],
    "patterns_introduced": ["P01"],
    ...
  }
}
```

---

## Pattern Evolution Across Seeds

### Early Seeds (S0001-S0100): Pattern ESTABLISHMENT

Introduce patterns with:
- Simple vocabulary
- Clear, unambiguous instances
- High frequency structures

Example:
```
S0001: Quiero hablar      (establish P01)
S0007: Quiero intentar    (reinforce P01)
S0012: Quiero adivinar    (reinforce P01)
```

### Middle Seeds (S0101-S0300): Pattern EXTENSION

Show pattern with:
- More vocabulary variation
- Compound constructions
- Pattern combinations

Example:
```
S0150: Quiero poder hablar        (P01 + P18)
S0200: Quiero empezar a practicar (P01 + another pattern)
```

### Later Seeds (S0301-S0668): Pattern MASTERY

Full natural usage:
- Patterns in complex sentences
- Multiple patterns per seed
- Idiomatic variations

---

## Pattern Naming Convention

### Format: P[NUMBER]

- **P01, P02, P03...** numbered sequentially
- Number indicates **introduction order** (P01 introduced before P02)
- Numbers MAY have gaps (P01, P02, P03, P05, P06...) if some patterns deprecated

### Internal Documentation:

```json
{
  "code": "P01",
  "parent_seed": "S0001",
  "structure": "Quiero + infinitive",
  "description": "First person want + action",
  "learner_description": "Use 'quiero' + any verb to say 'I want to [do that thing]'",
  "category": "verb_phrase_modal",
  "introduced_seed": "S0001",
  "reinforcement_seeds": ["S0007", "S0012", "S0015", ...]
}
```

## Using Patterns in Basket Generation

Baskets MUST demonstrate pattern usage:

**For P01 (Quiero + infinitive):**

Generate practice phrases showing:
1. **Pattern recognition** (2-3 phrases):
   - "I want to speak" / "Quiero hablar"
   - "I want to learn" / "Quiero aprender"
   → Learner sees: SAME pattern, different verb

2. **Pattern variation** (3-4 phrases):
   - Negative: "I don't want to..." / "No quiero..."
   - Question: "Do you want to...?" / "¿Quieres...?"
   - Combined with other patterns

3. **Conversational usage** (5+ phrases):
   - Natural multi-LEGO sentences using the pattern
   - Shows pattern in realistic context

## Quality Checklist for Patterns

Before marking something as a pattern, verify:

- [ ] **Substitutability**: Can swap vocabulary without changing structure?
- [ ] **Frequency**: Will appear 3+ times across course?
- [ ] **Recognizability**: Would learner say "I've seen this before"?
- [ ] **Clear invariant**: Can define what stays the same?
- [ ] **Clear variants**: Can define what changes (the slots)?
- [ ] **Pedagogical value**: Does recognizing pattern help learning?
- [ ] **Language-specific**: Is structure notable in target language?

---

## Examples Across Languages

### Spanish Patterns (Romance)

Core patterns:
- Verb + infinitive modals (quiero, puedo, necesito, debo + infinitive)
- Verb + gerund progressives (estoy, estaba + gerund)
- Periphrastic future (voy a + infinitive)
- Subjunctive triggers (después de que, antes de que + subjunctive)

### Chinese Patterns (Isolating)

Core patterns:
- Verb + 得 + complement (degree/result)
- Modal placement (想, 要, 能, 会 + verb)
- 的 constructions (possessive, relative clauses)
- Aspect markers (了, 着, 过)
- Temporal clauses (的时候, 之前, 之后)

### Key Differences:
- Spanish: conjugation-heavy, more patterns around tense/mood
- Chinese: particle-heavy, more patterns around word order and aspect

## Pattern Documentation Template

For each identified pattern, document:

```markdown
## P[NUMBER]: [Structure Name]

**Parent Seed**: S00XX
**Structure**: [Invariant] + [Variant]
**Category**: [verb_phrase / tense_aspect / subordinate / question / impersonal / language_specific]

**Invariant Element(s)**:
- What stays the same

**Variant Slot(s)**:
- What changes (infinitive / gerund / noun / adjective)

**Instances in Course**:
- S00XX: [example]
- S00YY: [example]
- S00ZZ: [example]

**Learner-Facing Description**:
"One sentence explanation of how to use this pattern"

**Contrast with English** (if applicable):
- How English expresses the same meaning
- What's different structurally

**Common Errors**:
- What learners typically get wrong with this pattern
```

---

## Integration with Phase 3 Extraction

When extracting:

1. **Identify pattern-bearing LEGOs**
   - Mark with `pattern_demonstrated`
   - Track in seed-level `patterns_used` and `patterns_introduced`

2. **Ensure pattern LEGOs are molecular enough**
   - Must show the full pattern structure
   - "Quiero" alone ≠ pattern
   - "Quiero hablar" = shows pattern

3. **Track pattern introductions chronologically**
   - First appearance = pattern established
   - Later appearances = pattern reinforced

4. **Use patterns for basket generation GATE**
   - Can only use patterns introduced ≤ current seed
   - Example: S0020 baskets can use P01-P18, but NOT P19 (introduced S0061)

---

## Summary: The Pattern Mindset

When extracting LEGOs, constantly ask:

**"Is this a STRUCTURE that will recur with different WORDS?"**

If YES → Identify the pattern
- Define the invariant (what stays same)
- Define the variants (what changes)
- Mark LEGOs that demonstrate it
- Track for basket generation

If NO → It's just vocabulary
- Extract as LEGO
- No pattern marking needed

**The goal:** Learners should finish the course thinking:
- "Spanish uses [structure X] for [purpose Y]"
- NOT just "I memorized 1000 sentences"

**Pattern recognition = language acquisition**
**Vocabulary memorization ≠ language acquisition**

Patterns are the SPINE. Vocabulary is the FLESH.
