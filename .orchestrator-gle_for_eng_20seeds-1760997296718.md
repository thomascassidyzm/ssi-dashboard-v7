# Course Generation Orchestrator Brief

## Mission
Generate complete SSi language course from canonical English seeds.

**Course**: gle_for_eng_20seeds
**Target Language**: gle (learning language)
**Known Language**: eng (learner's language)
**Seeds**: 20 (total canonical sentences to process)

---

## Your Role

You are the **course generation orchestrator**. You will execute all 7 phases sequentially in this single Claude Code session. Work autonomously - read specs, execute phases, write outputs, report status.

---

## Key Files

**APML Specification** (Single Source of Truth):
`/Users/tomcassidy/SSi/ssi-dashboard-v7-clean/ssi-course-production.apml`
- Read this FIRST
- Contains all phase prompts and rules
- VERSION: 7.3.0

**Course Directory** (Your workspace):
`/Users/tomcassidy/SSi/ssi-dashboard-v7-clean/vfs/courses/gle_for_eng_20seeds`
- Write all outputs here
- VFS structure: translations.json, baskets.json, phase_outputs/

**Canonical Seeds** (Input data):
`/Users/tomcassidy/SSi/SSi_Course_Production/vfs/seeds/canonical_seeds.json`
- 668 English sentences to translate and process

---

## Phase Execution Sequence

Execute phases in order. **Read APML for detailed instructions** - it contains the actual prompts and rules.

### Phase 1: Pedagogical Translation
- **Input**: canonical_seeds.json (first 20 seeds)
- **Output**: translations.json (single file, all SEED_PAIRS)
- **Prompt**: Read from APML Phase 1 section
- **Purpose**: Apply 6 heuristics, create optimized translations
- **Critical**: Two-step process (canonical→target→known)

### Phase 3: LEGO Extraction
- **Input**: translations.json
- **Output**: Store LEGOs in baskets.json structure (prepare for Phase 5)
- **Prompt**: Read from APML Phase 3 section (uses LEGO Extraction Skill)
- **Purpose**: Extract FD-compliant LEGOs (BASE + COMPOSITE)
- **Critical**: FD (Functionally Deterministic), FCFS (First Come First Served), TILING test

### Phase 5: Basket Generation
- **Input**: LEGOs from Phase 3
- **Output**: baskets.json (single file, all LEGO_BASKETS with e-phrases and d-phrases)
- **Prompt**: Read from APML Phase 5 section
- **Purpose**: Generate learning baskets with progressive vocabulary
- **Critical**: 7-10 word e-phrases, perfect target grammar

**NOTE**: APML contains the full details. These are just the key milestones. Read APML phase sections for complete instructions.

## Critical Rules

1. **Read APML First**: All phase details are in ssi-course-production.apml
2. **Sequential Execution**: Complete each phase before starting next
3. **Write to VFS**: All outputs go to /Users/tomcassidy/SSi/ssi-dashboard-v7-clean/vfs/courses/gle_for_eng_20seeds
4. **Quality Validation**: After Phase 5, spot-check 5-10 baskets for grammar
5. **Report Status**: At end, report completion or failure with specifics

---

## Quality Checkpoints

### After Phase 1
- Spot-check 5 translations: Natural? High-frequency vocabulary?

### After Phase 3
- Spot-check 10 LEGOs: Pass FD (Functionally Deterministic)? FCFS compliant? TILING correct?

### After Phase 5
- Spot-check 10 baskets: 7-10 word e-phrases? Perfect target grammar?
- Check for grammar errors (e.g., Italian: cercando di, imparando a)

If critical issues found: Document them, but continue (self-healing on next run).

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All 3 phases executed (1, 3, 5)
✅ Phase outputs written to VFS (translations.json, baskets.json)
✅ No critical errors (translations natural, LEGOs FD-compliant, baskets grammatical)
✅ Status reported

---

## Failure Handling

If any phase fails:
1. Document specific error
2. Note which seeds/LEGOs/baskets affected
3. Report failure status with details
4. Do NOT continue to next phase

---

## Final Report Format

After all phases (or on failure), report:

```
✅ Course Generation Complete: gle_for_eng_20seeds

Phase 1: ✅ 20 translations created → translations.json
Phase 3: ✅ [X] LEGOs extracted ([Y] BASE, [Z] COMPOSITE)
Phase 5: ✅ [X] baskets generated → baskets.json

Quality Checks:
- Translations: [Natural/Issues found]
- LEGOs: [FD-compliant/Issues found]
- Baskets: [Grammar perfect/Issues found]

Status: COMPLETE
Next: Review in dashboard at https://ssi-dashboard-v7.vercel.app
```

## Begin Execution

Read APML spec, execute Phase 1, then Phase 3, then Phase 5. Report status when complete.
