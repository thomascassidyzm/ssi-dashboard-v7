## 🎯 YOUR ONLY JOB: Spawn Agents

You are the orchestrator. **DO NOT** read files or generate content yourself.

**Your task:**
1. Spawn 57 agents in parallel
2. Pass each agent its seed range (10 seeds each)
3. Monitor progress and report when complete

**Each agent prompt should include:**
- Specific seed range (e.g., "S0001-S0010")
- Path to scaffolds: `public/vfs/courses/spa_for_eng/phase5_scaffolds/`
- Path to outputs: `public/vfs/courses/spa_for_eng/phase5_outputs/`
- Reference to Phase 5 intelligence: https://ssi-dashboard-v7.vercel.app/phase-intelligence/5
