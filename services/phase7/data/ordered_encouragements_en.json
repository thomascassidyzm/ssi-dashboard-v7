First of all, did you know that your brain has about 100 billion neurons? That\u2019s about as many neurons as there are stars in our galaxy. Whatever you might have been told at school, your brain is truly remarkable\u2014so you should trust in your brain\u2019s ability to learn languages. All brains are very, very good at learning when they\u2019re given the right work to do, and I\u2019m going to give you exactly the right work to do. So let\u2019s carry on. Oh, and if you\u2019re making mistakes sometimes, that\u2019s okay\u2014that\u2019s good, actually\u2014mistakes help you learn, and I\u2019ll tell you more about that later on. But please keep on making mistakes!",

Now, it\u2019s amazing that your brain has as many neurons as there are stars in the galaxy\u2014but it\u2019s even more important how those neurons connect to each other. It\u2019s the connections that create all the different possible pathways through the brain. If each neuron was connected to just 3 or 4 other neurons, the number of possible pathways through the brain would be gigantic. Now it\u2019s not easy to measure, but it\u2019s generally accepted that on average, each neuron has about SEVEN THOUSAND connections to other neurons. Which means that the number of pathways through the brain is more than there are atoms in the universe. That is how unbelievably amazing your brain is, and why it WILL learn a new language for you. And there\u2019s an approach we take, called the 10% rule, that helps make it all happen\u2014it\u2019s incredibly important, and I\u2019ll tell you more about that later on.",

If it surprised you that your brain has 100 billion neurons and more pathways than there are atoms in the universe, there\u2019s one more thing you need to know. The connections between your neurons\u2014we call them synapses\u2014they keep on changing, all the time. We form new synapses all the time, whenever we do anything new\u2014the brain rebuilds itself from moment to moment. Right now, as you listen to this, your brain is building new synapses. Every single sentence you manage to say in your new language, your brain is building new synapses. Your brain isn\u2019t just like the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer\u2014it reinvents itself all the time, and that\u2019s its superpower. Your true ability to learn is beyond anything you\u2019ve ever been told, and one of the most important ways your brain learns is by making lots of mistakes\u2014mistakes help you go faster, so I do hope you\u2019re making plenty\u2014and I haven\u2019t forgotten that I promised that I\u2019ll tell you how they\u2019re helping you later on.",

Here\u2019s what it is. If you do something you can already do, you\u2019re not getting better\u2014you\u2019re just maintaining your existing level. If you can do 10 pressups, and you do 10 pressups, well done\u2014you\u2019re keeping yourself able to do 10 pressups\u2014but you\u2019re not going to get any better just by doing 10 pressups. If you can do 10 pressups, and I ask you to do 100 pressups, then you\u2019re going to fail\u2014you can\u2019t improve that quickly\u2014so you\u2019ll try, and you\u2019ll fail, and you\u2019ll feel bad, and you won\u2019t get better. But if I ask you to do 11 pressups\u201410% more\u2014you can do that, and you just got slightly better. If you do 10% more every day, it will take you less than 30 days to do 100 pressups. In our next break, I\u2019ll tell you more about what this means for your new language.",

So that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing with the SaySomethingin Method. It's designed to keep you as close as possible to being 10% out of your comfort zone all the time. The sentences that are too long, the words that we haven\u2019t practised for a while, the new structures we throw in\u2014everything in the method is designed to keep you 10% out of your comfort zone. We\u2019ve shared this technique with educators and sports coaches and media personalities and government officers\u2014because it works everywhere you use it. Anything you ever want to get better at, just look for what you can do that is 10% beyond your comfort zone, and keep going 10% beyond for long enough, and the results will amaze you. And with your new language, all you have to do is trust this method\u2014I will never let it become too easy for you, so you\u2019ll never stop getting better!

Perfection is not how languages work\u2014we speak quickly, we change our minds halfway through what we were saying, we forget things, we start again\u2014if you recorded yourself speaking your first language and then got someone to transcribe it, you\u2019d be amazed how many so-called mistakes you make.

And there\u2019s one very important truth with learning a language\u2014it\u2019s almost as important as the 10% rule\u2014the more you talk, the faster you learn. And when you worry about making mistakes\u2014when you want to be perfect\u2014you talk less, and you learn more slowly.

This slows down your learning\u2014it\u2019s much better to jump in and say whatever you can, as quickly as you can, and then listen carefully to the models. Perfectionists hate the 10% rule\u2014they want everything to be under control, so that they can get everything right\u2014and science shows that this leads to slower learning. The 10% rule is vital for all learning\u2014you have to be far enough outside your comfort zone to be uncomfortable and to make mistakes\u2014that\u2019s where all the fastest and the best learning happens. If you won\u2019t go there because you want to be perfect, your learning is going to suffer, and you\u2019re less likely to become a confident speaker.

Instead of trying to get every sentence perfect, what if you decided to aim for perfection in HOW you learn? If you decided to learn in the fastest, best, most perfect possible way? Because perfection in language learning means going as fast as possible and making as many mistakes as possible and giving your brain as much exposure to the new language as possible. If you do all those things, you\u2019re getting close to perfection as a language learner. If you tell yourself that every single time you make a mistake, you\u2019re getting closer to being the perfect learner, maybe that will help you let go of your need to be in control\u2014and once you let go of that need for control, your success is inevitable.

Why should you feel embarrassed that you\u2019re learning a wonderful new skill? And the speaking is very important\u2014because it adds extra neural circuits to the memories that you\u2019re building, and the more neural circuits we add to a memory, the stronger it becomes. If you speak out loud in every single gap\u2014you don\u2019t have to be perfect, just say whatever words you can remember\u2014then you are building stronger memories, and you\u2019re building them faster, and you\u2019re going to be more successful.
