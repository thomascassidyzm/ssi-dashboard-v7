# .project/ - Working Files

This directory contains **ephemeral project communications** - briefs, decisions, and session notes that support active development.

## Structure

- `briefs/` - Task briefs for orchestrator agents
- `decisions/` - Key architectural and design decisions
- `session-notes/` - Session handoffs and context transfers

## Purpose

These files are **working documents** for:
- AI agent coordination
- Session-to-session context
- Decision tracking during development

## Not For

- System documentation (see main `docs/` when created)
- Source content (see `canonical_seeds.json`, `ssi-course-production.apml`)
- Generated content (see `vfs/`)

## Git

Can be gitignored or committed - your choice. These are development artifacts, not system components.
