## 15 Learned Italian-Specific Rules

### Grammar & Structure Rules

1. **Preposition + Article Contractions** - Always keep atomic (del, nella, sugli, etc.)
2. **Reflexive Verb Phrases** - Never split pronouns from verbs (mi piace, ti senti)
3. **Modal + Infinitive** - Keep modal verbs with infinitives (devo andare, posso fare)
4. **Essential Phrasal Verbs** - Protect high-frequency patterns (ho bisogno di, sto cercando di)
5. **Compound Tenses** - Keep auxiliaries with participles (ho fatto, sono andato)
6. **Article + Noun Units** - Never separate articles from nouns (il libro, la ragazza)
7. **Idiomatic Expressions** - Preserve cultural idioms (fare finta di, mettersi d'accordo)
8. **Negation Patterns** - Keep "non" with negated verb
9. **Clitic Pronouns** - Handle attached pronouns correctly (dirmelo, farglielo)
10. **Prepositional Phrases** - Extract "a/di + infinitive" as teaching units

### Advanced Patterns

11. **Comparative Structures** - Keep "più/meno... di/che" together
12. **Question Words** - Maintain interrogative + dependent structure (cosa vuoi, come ti chiami)
13. **Conditional Constructions** - Preserve "se + verb" patterns
14. **Time Expressions** - Keep temporal phrases intact (prima di, dopo che, mentre)
15. **Discourse Markers** - Extract connectors appropriately (quindi, perché, però, ma)

**Impact:** These rules achieved 100% IRON RULE compliance and near-perfect naturalness scores.

## Quality Distribution

### Score Breakdown

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Excellent (9.0-10.0)** | 498 | 74.6% |
| **Good (8.0-8.9)** | 167 | 25.0% |
| **Flagged (5.0-7.9)** | 3 | 0.4% |
| **Failed (<5.0)** | 0 | 0.0% |

**The 3 flagged seeds are unavoidable single-word canonical entries:**
- Seed 259: "Un'idea." (An idea.)
- Seed 305: "Donna." (Woman.)
- Seed 338: "Male." (Badly.)

*These represent acceptable edge cases from the source corpus.*
