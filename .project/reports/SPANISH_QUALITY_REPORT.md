## Learned Rules

The system discovered **5** language-specific rules during self-review:

### Critical Rules (Iron Rule Enforcement)

1. **R001**: Keep reflexive verbs together: "me gusta", "se puede", etc.
   - Impact: 0 SEEDs improved
   - Learned in: Cycle 0

2. **R002**: Never split compound prepositions: "a través de", "al lado de"
   - Impact: 0 SEEDs improved
   - Learned in: Cycle 0

### High Priority Rules (Spanish Linguistics)

1. **R003**: Keep idiomatic expressions intact: "tener que", "estar de acuerdo"
   - Impact: 0 SEEDs improved

2. **R004**: Preserve verb + infinitive constructions: "quiero hablar", "voy a aprender"
   - Impact: 0 SEEDs improved

### Medium Priority Rules (Consistency & Polish)

1. **R005**: Keep question words with their verb: "¿Cómo estás?", "¿Qué quieres?"
