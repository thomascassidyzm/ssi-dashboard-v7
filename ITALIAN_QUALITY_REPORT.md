## Technical Implementation

### Extraction Algorithm

**Algorithm:** Phrase-boundary detection with pattern protection

**Key Features:**
- Protected phrase ranges (essential patterns never split)
- Dynamic scoring (length, naturalness, teaching value)
- IRON RULE pre-validation
- Italian-specific pattern bonuses

**Complexity:** O(n × m) where n = words, m = max phrase length (6)

### Quality Scoring Formula

```
Base Score: 100 points

Penalties:
- IRON RULE violation: -20 points each
- Split phrase: -5 points each
- Low LEGO count (<2): -20 points
- Over-fragmented (>8): -10 points
- Low pedagogical score: -10 points
- Poor word distribution: -10 points

Final Score: (Total / 10) capped at [0, 10]
```

### Self-Review Process

1. **Identify Flagged Seeds:** Score < 8.0
2. **Analyze Issue Patterns:** Group by issue type
3. **Generate Improvement Rules:** Language-specific patterns
4. **Re-extract with Enhanced Logic:** Apply learned rules
5. **Validate Improvement:** Require +0.5 score gain
6. **Update Attempt History:** Track all iterations

---

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. ✅ **Deploy Immediately** - Quality exceeds all targets
2. ✅ **Use as Reference** - Template for future languages
3. ✅ **Monitor Edge Cases** - Track single-word seeds in usage data
4. ✅ **Document Patterns** - Create Italian pattern library

### For Future Languages

1. **Pre-identify Language-Specific Patterns:** Build comprehensive phrase list before extraction
2. **Start with Protected Ranges:** Identify essential phrases that must stay intact
3. **Custom Preposition Lists:** Each language needs exhaustive preposition mapping
4. **Pattern-Based Scoring:** Weight scoring toward language-specific structures

### For Further Improvement

1. **Human Review:** Optional review of 3 flagged seeds (already at 99.6% acceptance)
2. **Usage Analytics:** Track which LEGOs are most effective in teaching
3. **A/B Testing:** Test alternative segmentations for edge cases
4. **Cross-Language Learning:** Apply Italian rules to Romance language courses
