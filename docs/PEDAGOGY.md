## Core Concepts

### What is a LEGO?

A **LEGO** is a discrete unit of learning - the smallest "building block" that a learner masters as a single piece.

Think of it like learning to code: you learn individual functions one at a time, then combine them into programs.

**Three types (cognitive load management):**

#### Base (B): Atomic Units
- **Definition**: Indivisible language chunks that cannot be broken down further
- **Examples**:
  - Spanish: "Quiero" (I want), "hablar" (to speak), "ahora" (now)
  - Italian: "Voglio" (I want), "parlare" (to speak), "adesso" (now)
  - French: "Je veux" (I want), "parler" (to speak), "maintenant" (now)
- **Teaching approach**: Taught as a single atomic piece
- **Learner experience**: Master one concept at a time

#### Feeder (F): Component Parts
- **Definition**: Parts of a larger phrase, taught FIRST to reduce cognitive load
- **Examples**:
  - Spanish: "Estoy" (I'm), "intentando" (trying) → will combine into "Estoy intentando"
  - Italian: "Sto" (I'm), "provando" (trying) → will combine into "Sto provando"
  - French: "Je suis" (I am), "en train de" (in the process of) → will combine into "Je suis en train de"
- **Teaching approach**: Learner masters each part individually BEFORE seeing the combination
- **Cognitive load**: **1 new thing** per step (each feeder separately)

#### Composite (C): Combined Phrases
- **Definition**: Combination of feeders, taught AFTER parts are already known
- **Examples**:
  - Spanish: "Estoy intentando" (I'm trying) ← learner already knows "Estoy" + "intentando"
  - Italian: "Sto provando" (I'm trying) ← learner already knows "Sto" + "provando"
  - French: "Je suis en train de" (I'm in the process of) ← learner already knows both parts
- **Teaching approach**: By the time learner sees this, they recognize both parts
- **Cognitive load**: **1 new thing** (just learning how the parts combine)

#### Why This Order Matters: Feeders → Composites

**Scenario 1: Teach feeders first (SSi method)**
1. Learn "Estoy" separately → easy ✅
2. Learn "intentando" separately → easy ✅
3. See "Estoy intentando" → recognize both parts, just learning combination → easy ✅
4. **Total cognitive load**: 3 steps, each manageable

**Scenario 2: Teach composite first (traditional method)**
1. See "Estoy intentando" for first time
2. Learner must understand:
   - What is "Estoy"? ❓
   - What is "intentando"? ❓
   - How do they combine? ❓
3. **Total cognitive load**: 3 unknowns simultaneously → overwhelming ❌

**Result**: SSi method distributes cognitive load across time, making learning smoother.

### What is a Basket?

A **basket** is NOT a random collection of practice phrases.

A basket is a **demonstration of how THIS LEGO plugs into LEGOs the learner ALREADY knows.**

#### The API Documentation Metaphor

Think of learning LEGOs like learning a programming language:

- **LEGO** = a new function you're learning (e.g., `filter()`)
- **Basket** = code examples showing how to use this function
- **Available vocabulary** = variables and functions already defined in previous code
- **Iron Rule** = You cannot use undefined variables in your examples

#### What a Basket Contains

Each basket for a LEGO contains practice phrases that show:

1. **How the new LEGO interfaces with prior knowledge**
   - "Here's how 'intentando' combines with 'hablar' (which you already know)"

2. **Different contexts where the LEGO can be used**
   - Affirmative: "Estoy intentando hablar" (I'm trying to speak)
   - Negative: "No estoy intentando adivinar" (I'm not trying to guess)
   - Question: "¿Estás intentando aprender?" (Are you trying to learn?)

3. **Progressive complexity** - two types of practice phrases with fundamentally different purposes

#### Example: Basket for "Quiero" (I want)

**Position in course**: LEGO #1 (first LEGO in course)
**Available vocabulary**: NONE (it's the first LEGO!)
**Basket contents**: Empty ✅ (correct!)

**Why empty?** You cannot demonstrate how "Quiero" combines with other LEGOs when no other LEGOs have been learned yet. This is pedagogically sound - don't force meaningless practice.

---

**Position in course**: LEGO #6 (after learning "Quiero", "hablar", "español", "contigo", "ahora")
**Available vocabulary**: Those 5 previous LEGOs
**Basket contents**:

**E-phrases (full sentences, 7-10 words)**:
- "Quiero hablar español contigo ahora mismo aquí" (I want to speak Spanish with you right now here)
- "No quiero hablar español ahora contigo todavía" (I don't want to speak Spanish with you yet now)

**D-phrases (progressive building)**:
- 2-LEGO: "Quiero hablar" (I want to speak)
- 3-LEGO: "Quiero hablar español" (I want to speak Spanish)
- 4-LEGO: "Quiero hablar español contigo" (I want to speak Spanish with you)
- 5-LEGO: "Quiero hablar español contigo ahora" (I want to speak Spanish with you now)

**Notice**: Every phrase uses ONLY the 6 LEGOs the learner has mastered so far. Zero unknowns except the LEGO being practiced.

### E-phrases vs D-phrases: The Critical Usage Pattern Distinction

This is a fundamental pedagogical distinction that explains WHY we have two types of practice phrases:

#### E-phrases (ETERNAL): Permanent Practice Material

**WHEN USED:**
- At ANY point in the course AFTER this LEGO's introduction
- Reusable FOREVER throughout the entire course

**HOW USED:**
- Learner at Lesson #1 introduces LEGO #10 → uses d-phrases for scaffolding
- Learner at Lesson #50 wants to practice LEGO #10 again → uses e-phrases
- Learner at Lesson #200 reviews LEGO #10 → uses e-phrases
- **These are the permanent practice sentences** for this LEGO

**WHY HIGH QUALITY MATTERS:**
- Practiced hundreds of times throughout the course
- Must be natural, conversational, high-quality sentences
- Represent best examples of how to use this LEGO
- Learners will say these phrases repeatedly - they must be worth saying

**EXAMPLES (for LEGO "Quiero"):**
- "Quiero hablar español contigo ahora mismo aquí" (I want to speak Spanish with you right now here)
- "No quiero hablar español ahora contigo todavía" (I don't want to speak Spanish with you yet now)

These are polished, natural sentences learners practice forever.

#### D-phrases (DEBUT): Temporary Scaffolding

**WHEN USED:**
- ONLY during this LEGO's FIRST introduction
- Used ONCE, never repeated thereafter

**HOW USED:**
- Learner sees LEGO #10 for the FIRST time
- D-phrases help them build up understanding progressively:
  - 2-LEGO: Simple combination
  - 3-LEGO: Adding complexity
  - 4-LEGO: More complex
  - 5-LEGO: Full sentence (approaching e-phrase quality)
- After this debut lesson → d-phrases discarded, e-phrases used for all future practice

**WHY FRAGMENTS ARE OKAY:**
- Temporary learning aids, not permanent practice
- Focus on demonstrating progressive complexity
- Syntactic correctness required, but naturalness less critical
- Shown once during debut, then never seen again

**EXAMPLES (for LEGO "Quiero" - first introduction):**
- 2-LEGO: "Quiero hablar" (I want to speak) ← fragment, but shows basic combination
- 3-LEGO: "Quiero hablar español" (I want to speak Spanish) ← building up
- 4-LEGO: "Quiero hablar español contigo" (I want to speak Spanish with you) ← more complex
- 5-LEGO: "Quiero hablar español contigo ahora" (I want to speak Spanish with you now) ← approaching full sentence

These fragments help learner understand "how to build up to a full sentence" - then they're discarded.

#### Why This Distinction Exists

**Problem**: Learners need different support at different times
- **First encounter** with a LEGO: Need scaffolding to understand how it combines
- **Ongoing practice** with a LEGO: Need excellent examples to practice repeatedly

**Solution**: Two types of phrases serving different pedagogical purposes
- **D-phrases**: Scaffolding for first introduction (temporary)
- **E-phrases**: Practice material for ongoing use (permanent)

**Analogy**: Learning to ride a bicycle
- **D-phrases** = training wheels (used once during initial learning, then removed)
- **E-phrases** = actual cycling (used forever after you've learned)

You wouldn't keep training wheels on forever - that's why d-phrases are discarded after debut.
You wouldn't start without training wheels - that's why d-phrases exist for first introduction.

### The Vocabulary Constraint: The Iron Law

**Core Principle:** A basket can ONLY use LEGOs the learner has already mastered.

#### Why This Matters

**Cognitive load management**:
- When practicing LEGO #10, the learner has mastered LEGOs #1-9
- Every practice phrase is 90% comprehensible (9 known LEGOs + 1 new LEGO being practiced)
- Learner can focus 100% on the new LEGO, not distracted by unknown vocabulary
- Confidence builds with each successful practice

**Contrast with traditional methods**:
- Traditional: Practice sentences may contain 3-5 unknowns simultaneously
- Learner confused: "Which word should I focus on?"
- Cognitive overload → frustration → reduced learning

**SSi approach**:
- Practice sentences contain EXACTLY 1 unknown (the LEGO being taught)
- Learner clear: "I'm practicing THIS new piece"
- Manageable load → confidence → accelerated learning

#### How It Works: Progressive Vocabulary Accumulation

The system tracks **chronological position** (not LEGO type):

```
Position #1: LEGO A → Available vocabulary: [] (empty)
Position #2: LEGO B → Available vocabulary: [A]
Position #3: LEGO C → Available vocabulary: [A, B]
Position #4: LEGO D → Available vocabulary: [A, B, C]
...
Position #N: LEGO Z → Available vocabulary: [A, B, C, ..., Y]
```

**Important**: Type (Base/Feeder/Composite) has ZERO effect on vocabulary availability!
**Only chronological position matters.**

Examples:
- Base LEGO at position #50 → Can use 49 LEGOs in practice phrases
- Composite LEGO at position #3 → Can only use 2 LEGOs in practice phrases
- Position is everything. Type determines HOW it's taught, not WHAT vocabulary is available.

## Teaching Sequence Example: Spanish Course

### Seed #1: "Quiero hablar español contigo ahora." (I want to speak Spanish with you now.)

**Phase 1: Translation** → Pedagogically optimized Spanish sentence

**Phase 3: LEGO Extraction** → Break into LEGOs:
- Position #1: S0001L01 (B, "Quiero")
- Position #2: S0001L02 (B, "hablar")
- Position #3: S0001L03 (B, "español")
- Position #4: S0001L04 (B, "contigo")
- Position #5: S0001L05 (B, "ahora")

**Phase 5: Basket Generation** → Create practice phrases:

**S0001L01 ("Quiero" - Position #1):**
- Basket: Empty (first LEGO, no prior vocabulary)

**S0001L02 ("hablar" - Position #2):**
- Can use: "Quiero" (position #1)
- E-phrases: (maybe 1-2 simple phrases if semantically valid)
  - "Quiero hablar" (I want to speak) - if this makes semantic sense
- D-phrases: Very limited

**S0001L03 ("español" - Position #3):**
- Can use: "Quiero", "hablar" (positions #1-2)
- E-phrases: (2-3 phrases building complexity)
  - "Quiero hablar español ahora ya mismo aquí" (I want to speak Spanish now right here) ← fills to 7+ words using known vocab
- D-phrases:
  - 2-LEGO: "Quiero hablar" (I want to speak)
  - 2-LEGO: "hablar español" (to speak Spanish)

...and so on, progressively building vocabulary.

### Seed #2: "Estoy intentando aprender." (I'm trying to learn.)

**Phase 3: LEGO Extraction** → Break into LEGOs:
- Position #6: S0002F01 (F, "Estoy") ← Feeder FIRST
- Position #7: S0002F02 (F, "intentando") ← Feeder FIRST
- Position #8: S0002L01 (C, "Estoy intentando") ← Composite AFTER feeders
- Position #9: S0002L02 (B, "aprender")

**Phase 5: Basket Generation:**

**S0002F01 ("Estoy" - Position #6):**
- Can use: "Quiero", "hablar", "español", "contigo", "ahora" (positions #1-5)
- E-phrases: (several combinations possible now!)
  - "Estoy contigo ahora queriendo hablar español aquí mismo" (I'm with you now wanting to speak Spanish right here)
  - "Ahora estoy hablando español contigo aquí ya mismo" (Now I'm speaking Spanish with you here right now)
- Starting to have rich vocabulary for meaningful practice!

**S0002L01 ("Estoy intentando" - Position #8):**
- Can use: All positions #1-7 (including its own feeders!)
- E-phrases:
  - "Estoy intentando hablar español contigo ahora mismo aquí" (I'm trying to speak Spanish with you right now here)
- **This is why feeders come first**: The composite basket can reference its own component parts in practice phrases, reinforcing the connection.

## Why This System Works

### 1. Graduated Cognitive Load
- Each LEGO introduces exactly ONE new concept
- Practice phrases contain ZERO unknowns except the LEGO being taught
- Learner never overwhelmed

### 2. Cumulative Knowledge Building
- Each new LEGO builds on all previous LEGOs
- No "islands" of knowledge - everything connects
- Confidence compounds over time

### 3. Meaningful Practice
- Every practice phrase is immediately comprehensible
- Learner sees how new knowledge integrates with existing knowledge
- Natural language use from day one (using available vocabulary)

### 4. Efficient Learning
- No wasted time on incomprehensible input
- Every practice session = 100% productive time
- Faster progress through clear, structured progression

## Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "Baskets are just random practice phrases"
**✅ Reality**: Baskets are carefully constrained demonstrations of how the new LEGO interfaces with known LEGOs only.

### ❌ "All LEGOs should have full baskets from day one"
**✅ Reality**: Early LEGOs (1-10) have empty or minimal baskets because there's no prior vocabulary yet. This is correct! Don't force meaningless phrases.

### ❌ "Composite LEGOs always have more practice than Base LEGOs"
**✅ Reality**: Vocabulary availability depends on POSITION, not TYPE. A Base LEGO at position #50 has far more practice opportunities than a Composite LEGO at position #3.

### ❌ "Feeders are less important than regular LEGOs"
**✅ Reality**: Feeders ARE regular LEGOs. They just happen to later combine into composites. They get their own baskets and are taught with the same care.

## For Course Creators

When generating courses, remember:

1. **Type (B/C/F) determines HOW you teach, not WHAT vocabulary is available**
   - Base = teach as atomic unit
   - Feeder = teach as part (learner knows it will combine later)
   - Composite = teach as combination (learner already knows the parts)

2. **Position determines vocabulary availability**
   - LEGO #1 has zero prior vocabulary → empty basket
   - LEGO #10 has 9 prior LEGOs → several practice phrases
   - LEGO #100 has 99 prior LEGOs → rich practice baskets

3. **Quality over quantity in practice phrases**
   - Better to have 2 excellent natural phrases than 5 forced awkward ones
   - If vocabulary is insufficient for quality practice, leave basket sparse
   - Learners progress through the course - sparse early baskets fill out as vocabulary grows

4. **Validate the pedagogy**
   - Every practice phrase uses ONLY known LEGOs?
   - LEGO being practiced appears in EVERY practice phrase?
   - Phrases are natural and meaningful in both target and known languages?

## For Learners

As you progress through an SSi course:

1. **Early lessons feel "incomplete"** ✅ This is normal!
   - You're learning foundation pieces
   - Practice is limited because you don't know enough words yet
   - Trust the process

2. **Middle lessons feel "expansive"** ✅ This is the payoff!
   - You know 30-50 LEGOs now
   - Practice phrases become rich and varied
   - You can express real ideas

3. **Later lessons feel "fluent"** ✅ This is mastery!
   - You know 100+ LEGOs
   - You recognize most words in new sentences
   - Learning new LEGOs feels effortless (1 new piece at a time)

---

## Summary

**LEGO** = discrete unit of learning (Base/Feeder/Composite)
**Basket** = practice demonstrating how THIS LEGO plugs into KNOWN LEGOs
**Vocabulary Constraint** = practice uses ONLY previously learned LEGOs
**Position** = chronological order determines available vocabulary
**Type** = determines HOW to teach, not WHAT vocabulary is available

**Result**: Graduated cognitive load, cumulative knowledge building, efficient learning.
