S0001|I want to speak {target} with you now.
S0002|I'm trying to learn.
S0003|how to speak as often as possible.
S0004|how to say something in {target}
S0005|I'm going to practise speaking with someone else.
S0006|I'm trying to remember a word.
S0007|I want to try as hard as I can today.
S0008|I'm going to try to explain what I mean.
S0009|I speak a little {target} now.
S0010|I'm not sure if I can remember the whole sentence.
S0011|I'd like to be able to speak after you finish.
S0012|I wouldn't like to guess what's going to happen tomorrow.
S0013|You speak {target} very well.
S0014|Do you speak {target} all day?
S0015|And I want you to speak {target} with me tomorrow.
S0016|He wants to come back with everyone else later on.
S0017|She wants to find out what the answer is.
S0018|We want to meet at six o'clock this evening.
S0019|But I don't want to stop talking.
S0020|You want to learn his name quickly.
S0021|Why are you learning her name?
S0022|Because I want to meet people who speak {target}.
S0023|I'm going to start talking more soon.
S0024|I'm not going to be able to remember easily.
S0025|Are you going to help me before I have to go?
S0026|I like feeling as if I'm nearly ready to go.
S0027|I don't like taking too much time to answer.
S0028|It's useful to start talking as soon as you can.
S0029|I'm looking forward to speaking better as soon as I can.
S0030|I wanted to ask you something yesterday.
S0031|You wanted to speak with me tonight.
S0032|Did you want to show me something?
S0033|How long have you been learning {target}?
S0034|He doesn't want to be quiet when other people are here.
S0035|She doesn't want to read anything this afternoon.
S0036|We don't want to interrupt the story.
S0037|I started to think about it carefully last month.
S0038|I've been learning for about a week.
S0039|But I'm a little tired this morning.
S0040|How do you feel at the moment?
S0041|I feel okay, but I'm starting to feel tired.
S0042|I was starting to feel better than last night.
S0043|I wasn't thinking about how to answer.
S0044|Or if I need to improve.
S0045|I don't need to know everything.
S0046|But I don't worry about making mistakes.
S0047|Because I think that it's a good thing to make mistakes.
S0048|I don't care about making mistakes.
S0049|It's like this, if you know what I mean.
S0050|I'm not trying to finish as quickly as possible.
S0051|I enjoy doing interesting things with my friends.
S0052|He wanted to write a letter to his friend last week.
S0053|She wanted to put his letter in her bag.
S0054|We wanted to give you a little more time.
S0055|I don't enjoy waking up when I didn't sleep very well.
S0056|So I can remember how to say a few words.
S0057|I can't remember how to say what I wanted to say.
S0058|It's interesting when you understand enough words.
S0059|I know how to do what I need to do next week.
S0060|I don't know how to say enough different words yet.
S0061|Could you say that again a little more slowly?
S0062|I'm not sure if I can help you at the same time.
S0063|Are you sure you don't mind helping me?
S0064|Learning {target} isn't easy but it is fun.
S0065|It's important to take time to test yourself.
S0066|It's not difficult to find the answer.
S0067|Why do you want to stop?
S0068|What are you looking for?
S0069|He didn't want to look after the young dog all afternoon.
S0070|She didn't want to tell me where it was.
S0071|We didn't want to let anyone hear the truth.
S0072|I think that you're doing very well.
S0073|Thank you very much, but I've got more to learn.
S0074|Thank you very much for helping me to understand.
S0075|Have you got more to learn?
S0076|I'm very happy with how much I've learnt already.
S0077|I'm surprised at how quickly I'm starting to understand.
S0078|I don't understand what you said.
S0079|When did you start to learn?
S0080|I'm not sure when I'll be ready.
S0081|When do you want to start?
S0082|I'm not going to wait for you. Why not?
S0083|I agree with what you said about your friend.
S0084|I don't agree with what he said about my friend.
S0085|I don't know those people.
S0086|It wasn't possible, unfortunately.
S0087|They are people I don't know.
S0088|I'm not ready to talk to people I don't know yet.
S0089|I think that I've done a lot in a short time.
S0090|If you can speak more slowly that would be great.
S0091|It's difficult to think quickly enough to answer in time.
S0092|I'd like to keep on doing this for a while.
S0093|It's time to go now.
S0094|This is the only way it will work.
S0095|Are you ready to go home on the next bus?
S0096|No I'm not ready yet, I need a little more time.
S0097|Yes I'm ready to go as soon as you want.
S0098|I should consider playing something else.
S0099|You should ask yourself why it's not working.
S0100|You shouldn't worry about doing something similar.
S0101|I'm enjoying finding out more about this language.
S0102|We're trying to say that it's not like that.
S0103|We're not trying to hear many more words.
S0104|We need to change what we're doing.
S0105|That is why he didn't know the answer.
S0106|We don't need to feel happy, we just need to work hard.
S0107|We hoped to see what you were doing.
S0108|We didn't hope to wake in the middle of the night.
S0109|We must work hard to learn a lot of new words.
S0110|We're friends, and after we finish I'd like to relax.
S0111|When we learn something new it changes our brain.
S0112|That was very interesting, and I wasn't expecting it.
S0113|Why can't I remember what you said?
S0114|I feel as if I'm doing worse today than yesterday.
S0115|I don't feel as if I'm ready to have a conversation.
S0116|This isn't the best choice I could make.
S0117|I'm definitely doing better than I was last time we talked to each other.
S0118|I feel better than I felt when we were in the pub.
S0119|Can I ask you something before you leave?
S0120|It's interesting that you like to go by bus.
S0121|It's unusual that you don't like to use your car.
S0122|It's starting to feel easier and I'm excited about how it's going.
S0123|I think that's a good idea.
S0124|I thought that was a good idea.
S0125|I believe that your idea was very good.
S0126|This work is changing the shape of my brain.
S0127|That isn't why I wanted to see you.
S0128|You're like someone I used to know.
S0129|I'm so happy that you're doing so well.
S0130|That was a surrpise, because he's my friend.
S0131|There are too many ideas going around in my head.
S0132|That's less exciting than what she was saying.
S0133|You get to know someone very well when you work together.
S0134|It's not a problem when you work at something difficult with them.
S0135|I don't know why you think that it's so good.
S0136|Of course you can ask her because she's my friend.
S0137|It's more important to talk often than to be perfect.
S0138|This was where my friend wanted to meet us.
S0139|I'm sorry that I need to leave so early.
S0140|I'm sorry that I can't see what you're trying to show me.
S0141|No problem. Everything is okay.
S0142|That's very kind of you and I'm grateful to you for helping.
S0143|It's the same thing as we were talking about earlier.
S0144|I woke earlier than I wanted to this morning.
S0145|Why are you not happy any more?
S0146|Nothing seems to be working since we tried to fix it.
S0147|She was very kind when she saw me feeling nervous.
S0148|He wasn't very patient when I couldn't answer.
S0149|This isn't very difficult, so I hope you'll finish soon.
S0150|Can you tell me what your name is?
S0151|That wasn't what I was hoping would happen.
S0152|I would have done it differently if I had known what you wanted.
S0153|I wouldn't have said it in exactly the same way.
S0154|Where do you want to meet on Saturday night?
S0155|I don't mind waiting for a few minutes tomorrow morning.
S0156|Do you want to go to a restaurant tonight?
S0157|I won't be able to be there next month.
S0158|Let's talk about something else.
S0159|That isn't what I'm trying to say.
S0160|How do you say this word in {target}?
S0161|Can you give me that book on Sunday morning?
S0162|What do you think about that?
S0163|I think that it's interesting.
S0164|An interesting book
S0165|But I'm not sure if it's true.
S0166|My name is not very unusual.
S0167|What do you need to do tomorrow afternoon?
S0168|And then I'll be able to come and help later on.
S0169|What do you want me to do?
S0170|I'd like you to tell me what you need.
S0171|Do you want me to help you look for it?
S0172|Yes that would be very helpful.
S0173|No thank you I can manage on my own.
S0174|Can you understand what I'm saying?
S0175|What do you want to do on Sunday morning?
S0176|I'll ask him if he'll be able to help next year.
S0177|I'll ask her where she wants to go.
S0178|I didn't have time, although I wanted to see you.
S0179|What are you going to do on Sunday afternoon?
S0180|I'd like to read my book for a while.
S0181|But I have to take my mother to the doctor.
S0182|Have you seen my keys anywhere?
S0183|No I'm afraid I haven't seen them.
S0184|Yes I saw them in the office a while ago.
S0185|I think you left them at work.
S0186|Do you want to talk about something different next week?
S0187|I'm happy so far.
S0188|So I don't need to change.
S0189|Yes that's a good idea.
S0190|Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
S0191|No I don't mind at all.
S0192|I'm busy tomorrow night.
S0193|I'm sorry but I'm too busy today.
S0194|What are you looking for?
S0195|I'm trying to find the money I left on the table.
S0196|Have you heard the latest idea?
S0197|My son works as a teacher.
S0198|My daughter works for the council.
S0199|My friend used to work in an office.
S0200|They say they want to make sure that we finish everything in time.
S0201|We wanted to know what was going to happen.
S0202|Nobody was sure how to answer the question.
S0203|What would you do if I asked you to help me?
S0204|I wanted her to help you to deal with the arrangements.
S0205|I've forgotten the word I was trying to say.
S0206|I enjoy the chance to practise speaking with you.
S0207|You've done what you needed to do.
S0208|I didn't want to ask you how to say it.
S0209|They want to spend more time meeting as a group.
S0210|They think that we need to discuss the problem.
S0211|They told us that they didn't want to explain.
S0212|They wanted to ask for help.
S0213|We don't know what they're trying to achieve.
S0214|Did you have a good time at the weekend?
S0215|I went out on Saturday night.
S0216|I saw a few friends.
S0217|I had a glass or two of water.
S0218|I didn't do much on Sunday.
S0219|It was nice to relax for a while.
S0220|Did you watch a bit of television?
S0221|I watched the football and then I watched a film.
S0222|He's trying to tell me what he wants
S0223|He's going to ask you tomorrow.
S0224|He's just started to learn.
S0225|He would give you an answer if he could.
S0226|The man is trying to help me.
S0227|That man is going to tell me something new.
S0228|That man has just started to practise speaking.
S0229|That woman would help you if she could.
S0230|I know a young man who wants to work with you.
S0231|I know an old man who wanted to ask for help.
S0232|I know an old woman who can remember the answer.
S0233|I know a young woman who knows your sister.
S0234|I met someone last night who works with your brother.
S0235|I met someone who said that he wanted to tell you something.
S0236|I know someone who said that she was going to try to help.
S0237|He wanted me to tell you before the weekend.
S0238|He wanted you to tell me yesterday.
S0239|My mother likes to read.
S0240|My father doesn't like to stop talking.
S0241|I don't want to give it to him.
S0242|I want to give her more time.
S0243|I'm going to ask for the same thing to eat.
S0244|I've learnt a lot already
S0245|I'm happy with how much I've done in a short time
S0246|I wanted her to help you but she was too busy.
S0247|I thought that book was fairly good.
S0248|I thought the film was complete rubbish and I want my money back.
S0249|I want you to help me before you go.
S0250|Can you tell me something else before I answer?
S0251|I don't want to find out until after we finish.
S0252|When will you be ready to start?
S0253|I should be ready in a few minutes.
S0254|I've been ready since this morning.
S0255|When do you think you'll be ready to leave?
S0256|I think I'll be ready in less than an hour.
S0257|I like that blue thing.
S0258|What's that blue thing over there?
S0259|An idea.
S0260|I don't have the faintest idea.
S0261|I think it might be something important.
S0262|Who was that man you were talking to yesterday?
S0263|I don't know who you mean.
S0264|An old man.
S0265|A friend.
S0266|He was an old friend of my father.
S0267|Have you heard from your friend?
S0268|Yes she sent me two emails last week.
S0269|Why don't you want to wait for your father?
S0270|Because I'm worried that I'm going to be late.
S0271|Would you like to come with us next month?
S0272|Yes that sounds like a great idea.
S0273|No unfortunately I've got too much work.
S0274|Do you have to leave in a few days?
S0275|Longer.
S0276|No I can stay here for a little longer.
S0277|Yes I've got an important meeting early next week.
S0278|Did you have to finish everything last night?
S0279|Yes because there wasn't much time left.
S0280|No I only had to do the most important job.
S0281|Do you mind if I finish my coffee before you start?
S0282|No that's not a problem.
S0283|Which of your friends speak {target}?
S0284|Do you know my sister's friend?
S0285|She speaks {target}.
S0286|People who like speaking {target}.
S0287|How many people do you know who like watching television?
S0288|Most people I know like watching television.
S0289|I wonder if she's going to be there this afternoon.
S0290|I wonder if he knows the answer.
S0291|I hope I'll be able to speak better soon.
S0292|I hope you'll be able to come to the party.
S0293|I have to find out where he's going to meet me.
S0294|I don't have enough time to call you tonight.
S0295|I didn't say that I wanted to finish in a day.
S0296|I said that I needed a little more time.
S0297|I don't know many people who speak {target}.
S0298|I've got nothing left to say.
S0299|He wants to pay half.
S0300|She doesn't want to seem unfriendly.
S0301|He said that he wants to show you something.
S0302|She said that she doesn't want to live in a city.
S0303|I think that he wants to sit down.
S0304|I think that she doesn't want to work from home.
S0305|Woman.
S0306|I know that young woman who's talking to your friend.
S0307|I know that young man who's sitting over there.
S0308|Yes she's a friend of my mother.
S0309|No I've never seen her before.
S0310|She could write a story about that man.
S0311|He couldn't believe the three most important facts.
S0312|She said that she could use the other room tomorrow night.
S0313|He said that he couldn't watch all five games.
S0314|I think that she could put it on the table.
S0315|I think that he couldn't afford the car that he wanted.
S0316|Do you think that she could bring her brother on Monday?
S0317|Yes I think she could if she wanted to.
S0318|No I don't think she could this time.
S0319|She needs to move to a different country.
S0320|He doesn't need to buy another television this year.
S0321|A book.
S0322|She said that she needs to read the same book.
S0323|He said that he doesn't need to walk to school.
S0324|That student has both of her hands up.
S0325|I think that he needs to consider ten possible problems.
S0326|I don't think that she needs to sell the company.
S0327|Do you think that she needs to offer another way?
S0328|Yes I think she ought to.
S0329|It's important.
S0330|No I don't think it's very important.
S0331|She can't provide all the answers.
S0332|He can build a new life for his sister.
S0333|She said that she can't spend much time with the group.
S0334|He said that he can let you hold the kitten
S0335|I think that he can add some valuable ideas.
S0336|I don't think that she can open the door.
S0337|Do you think that he can continue to play?
S0338|Badly.
S0339|No I think he's hurt himself quite badly.
S0340|Yes I'm sure he's going to be okay.
S0341|I met someone a few days ago.
S0342|I met someone who said something.
S0343|Who said that she's worried about the economy.
S0344|Who said that he's happy to help you.
S0345|Who said that he's not ready to leave yet.
S0346|I wanted her to know that I liked her book.
S0347|He wanted to know what was happening a week ago.
S0348|She didn't want to know what was going to happen.
S0349|Did he want to go out on Friday night?
S0350|Yes he wanted to see some old friends.
S0351|No he didn't want to leave me on my own.
S0352|Even if he wanted to he wouldn't be able to.
S0353|She needed to run around the field.
S0354|He didn't need to appear angry.
S0355|Did she need to talk to that woman you know?
S0356|Yes they had something important to discuss.
S0357|No she just wanted to send her a message.
S0358|Your friend said that she couldn't reach the top.
S0359|Your friend said that he could turn left.
S0360|Did your friend say anything else?
S0361|He was quiet.
S0362|No he was rather quiet after you left.
S0363|Yes he felt like talking a lot.
S0364|I heard that he didn't like that place.
S0365|I didn't hear what she said to him.
S0366|Did you hear what he wanted to grow?
S0367|No nobody told me.
S0368|Yes I heard that he wanted to grow tomatoes.
S0369|I saw several horses on the road.
S0370|I didn't see anyone that I knew.
S0371|I went to see a film on Wednesday.
S0372|Did you see what she was trying to create?
S0373|It was beautiful.
S0374|Yes I thought it was very beautiful.
S0375|No I didn't know what she was doing.
S0376|I didn't go anywhere last month.
S0377|Did you go anywhere in the world last year?
S0378|No I didn't have enough money for holidays.
S0379|Yes I was lucky enough to travel to Africa.
S0380|I asked what she wanted to include.
S0381|I didn't ask if he wanted to follow us.
S0382|Did you ask where he wanted to put it?
S0383|Yes he said he wanted to put it in the garden.
S0384|I couldn't agree with what he said a moment ago.
S0385|Did you agree with her?
S0386|Yes I agreed with her.
S0387|No I didn't think she was right.
S0388|That person you work with.
S0389|That person over there.
S0390|The one who is standing near the entrance.
S0391|The one who is walking towards the bus.
S0392|That child with the black hair opposite the post office.
S0393|That boy with the green shirt.
S0394|That girl with the yellow dress.
S0395|We need to turn left at the next corner.
S0396|We don't need to stand until everybody else is ready.
S0397|Do we need to get ready soon?
S0398|We want to become more patient with our children.
S0399|We don't want to lose hope.
S0400|Do we want to eat something later on?
S0401|No it would be better to go straight home.
S0402|Yes it would be nice to stop somewhere for food.
S0403|We should remain quiet for as long as possible.
S0404|We shouldn't expect to finish before Thursday.
S0405|Should we ask if we have to book?
S0406|No I'm sure it will be okay.
S0407|Shouldn't we try to set a good example?
S0408|Yes that's the best way to make a happy family.
S0409|No it doesn't matter what we do.
S0410|They still fight with each other.
S0411|We would like to reserve a table for four tonight.
S0412|We couldn't allow them to win everything.
S0413|We could fall if we go too close to the edge.
S0414|Could we have a bottle of red wine please?
S0415|That wouldn't be a problem if you ask me.
S0416|They want to lead the way next year.
S0417|Do they want to kill those ants?
S0418|They need to serve the community.
S0419|If they want people to like them.
S0420|They don't need to ask how old he is.
S0421|Because they already know he's getting weak.
S0422|A question.
S0423|Do they need to ask such an obvious question?
S0424|No they're wasting everybody's time.
S0425|Yes they need to make sure they understand.
S0426|They would like to love each other but they're unhappy.
S0427|They wouldn't like you to think that they're bored.
S0428|Would they like to visit us on Tuesday?
S0429|Yes that would be perfect for them.
S0430|No that wouldn't be possible.
S0431|They're not ready yet but they'll be ready soon.
S0432|They could mean that they want you to ask.
S0433|They couldn't find out when the film started.
S0434|Could they cut the number of students they take?
S0435|Yes they could if they wanted to.
S0436|No there's a minimum number they need.
S0437|They wanted to raise as much as possible for charity.
S0438|They didn't want to decide what he should do.
S0439|They don't want to die.
S0440|They want to travel while they're still young.
S0441|An approach.
S0442|Did they want to develop a new approach?
S0443|No they wanted to keep doing it the same way.
S0444|Yes they thought it could be done more efficiently.
S0445|They will be able to carry that suitcase.
S0446|They won't be able to break that window.
S0447|Will they be able to drive us home after the meal?
S0448|Yes they'll be happy to help.
S0449|They said that they were almost ready.
S0450|No they have to catch the train themselves.
S0451|They said what they wanted to do.
S0452|They didn't say what they wanted to do.
S0453|Did they say who they saw last night?
S0454|Our friends came round at about six o'clock.
S0455|We had to leave because the children were tired.
S0456|He might be there but it's not very likely.
S0457|Part of the problem is the number of different areas.
S0458|It was all much easier in the past.
S0459|It wasn't in front of the blue sign.
S0460|I want to find a shop near the hotel.
S0461|A shop where I can buy some postcards.
S0462|My grandfather fought in Italy during the war.
S0463|My room number.
S0464|I told her my room number once but she forgot it.
S0465|Next time I will ask her what her name is.
S0466|Let me throw it over the wall.
S0467|It's next to the car park.
S0468|It's a big world.
S0469|But that doesn't mean we can't change it.
S0470|How high do you want to climb before we stop?
S0471|Do you want to stop for a rest?
S0472|Part of the problem is that we don't know the facts.
S0473|I don't want it.
S0474|I don't even want it as a free offer.
S0475|There are many reasons to consider waiting.
S0476|I'm waiting for the end of the second half.
S0477|He's been sick since the second day of the holidays.
S0478|She has such a kind heart.
S0479|It's the least I could do.
S0480|Whatever he says it's not far ahead now.
S0481|It's the only real hope we have left.
S0482|The only real hope is that they're not serious.
S0483|Life isn't easy but it's not meant to be easy.
S0484|It's meant to be a challenge.
S0485|Nothing would make me happier than to get away.
S0486|I think your eyes are beautiful.
S0487|It's under the bridge.
S0488|It's on the other side of that yellow line.
S0489|If you don't make me a strong cup of coffee right now.
S0490|Then I will never trust anyone ever again.
S0491|I love the way you try to help.
S0492|Which of those places do you think is the most interesting?
S0493|What's going to come next?
S0494|What happens after the first part of the show?
S0495|When it matters.
S0496|I'm not planning to lose when it really matters.
S0497|That sounds as though you need to get some sleep.
S0498|He's standing alone over there inside the entrance.
S0499|Maybe we should open the door and close the window.
S0500|Why don't you want to sit between the two girls?
S0501|If only I could trust you to play together without arguing.
S0502|She almost got lost because she turned left instead of right.
S0503|I hate making trouble but that one's mine.
S0504|I'm going to run across the grass.
S0505|So that I don't get left behind.
S0506|I used to live around here years ago before we moved.
S0507|We moved to the city.
S0508|There's no point worrying about how you're going to pay.
S0509|I heard that you're going to pay for a new bed.
S0510|She's gone to look for somewhere safe to park the car.
S0511|The news took several hours to reach everyone in the office.
S0512|Can you hold the door open while I fetch the keys?
S0513|It hurts most when I move my head up and down.
S0514|I found the perfect house on the first day.
S0515|On the first day of the new year.
S0516|They both came on their own.
S0517|But they left with each other.
S0518|I couldn't imagine myself having exactly the same problem.
S0519|I haven't seen their new baby yet.
S0520|It might have happened to the whole family.
S0521|I'm afraid that you'll forget why we needed to stay here.
S0522|Let's agree that it was stupid to tell the truth.
S0523|Instead of giving an excuse.
S0524|I'll call you back in three or four minutes.
S0525|To check if you've been able to finish.
S0526|I'm finding it hard to believe that you can't guess.
S0527|Guess who told me that funny story.
S0528|I'm probably supposed to keep those things in another room.
S0529|Can you all put your hands up?
S0530|So I can count them
S0531|It isn't true that anyone can win the game.
S0532|Unless they're lucky.
S0533|She won't listen to every word you say.
S0534|Let's not go outside in this dreadful weather.
S0535|He made a promise that he wouldn't choose the wrong job.
S0536|I used to think that being crazy was bad.
S0537|But I was wrong.
S0538|I don't want to seem as though I don't care.
S0539|But it's getting late.
S0540|I don't mind if you want to leave without the car.
S0541|It's a good idea to try and breathe slowly.
S0542|Whenever you feel angry.
S0543|She was right.
S0544|Whoever said it would be difficult was absolutely right.
S0545|It's your turn to take the clean clothes upstairs.
S0546|The dog is dirty and wet.
S0547|Because he has been playing in the mud.
S0548|I am feeling sad at the moment.
S0549|Because I have got to be quiet.
S0550|The end of the village.
S0551|The church is ugly.
S0552|The church at the other end of the village is ugly.
S0553|I think the small church is very ugly.
S0554|This towel isn't dry.
S0555|And I'm too tired to fetch a new one.
S0556|They play music late at night.
S0557|I wish they wouldn't play such loud music.
S0558|It's so late at night.
S0559|Have you found the path through the wood?
S0560|It goes down to the beach
S0561|I don't care if it's a fast car.
S0562|I just want to get there safely.
S0563|I wouldn't have been able to keep going any longer.
S0564|I wouldn't have been able to without your help.
S0565|I'd have thought about it more carefully.
S0566|I'd have thought more if it had been my choice.
S0567|It's been lovely spending time outdoors watching the children play.
S0568|I'm expecting to see an improvement next time we meet.
S0569|Have you decided how much you are willing to pay?
S0570|How much are you willing to pay for your ticket?
S0571|I'm not convinced that would be a very good idea.
S0572|Have you forgotten what happened the last time they visited us?
S0573|It's the kind of thing that makes the holidays very special.
S0574|The holidays are very special for everyone.
S0575|It's been upsetting.
S0576|It has been very upsetting waiting.
S0577|We've been waiting for the news from the hospital.
S0578|Somewhere warmer.
S0579|We've often tried.
S0580|We've often wanted to take the children somewhere a little warmer.
S0581|He'd like to know a little more about what it's like.
S0582|What's it like to grow up here?
S0583|What's it like in this part of the world?
S0584|What's it like to wake up every morning and see the mountains?
S0585|I can see the mountains out of my bedroom window.
S0586|I want twenty boiled eggs.
S0587|She used to insist that we had eggs for supper.
S0588|So I wanted to grow up and leave home.
S0589|She told me she'd just seen the last bus.
S0590|I saw the last bus leaving the station.
S0591|She followed me down to the shops.
S0592|And along the main road.
S0593|However much I argued I still had to share.
S0594|I had to share my toys with my sister.
S0595|I need to lie down in the garden.
S0596|And I need to close my eyes for a while.
S0597|I suspect that he's heard a hundred stories about it.
S0598|He's heard a thousand stories about what they were doing.
S0599|I'd have been happy to drive if you'd told me.
S0600|I'd have driven if you'd told me how tired you were.
S0601|We were talking about how it all started.
S0602|How it started in the first place.
S0603|We didn't have anywhere to live at the time.
S0604|She offered to let us stay with her.
S0605|Because we needed help.
S0606|If I'd known then what I know now I'd have waited.
S0607|If I'd known I'd have done things differently.
S0608|It would have been the sensible thing to do.
S0609|The sensible thing to do would have been to ask.
S0610|He needs to look for work.
S0611|I would have been ready to look somewhere else.
S0612|We would have bought something.
S0613|We probably would have bought a house there.
S0614|It's near where your family live.
S0615|I thought you were very brave to say that.
S0616|You were very brave to say you thought that.
S0617|You thought that it was a mistake.
S0618|It doesn't feel like a long time.
S0619|It's a long time since we saw each other.
S0620|It's a very long time since we last saw each other.
S0621|I wouldn't have dared to tell her that it was broken.
S0622|I knew that the children had broken it.
S0623|Do you want a cup of coffee or tea?
S0624|Yes, that would be great, please.
S0625|Do you want something to drink?
S0626|No, I'm not thirsty, thank you.
S0627|Your coffee is ready.
S0628|Do you like tea?
S0629|I like it with milk but without sugar.
S0630|Can I have something to drink please?
S0631|What would you like?
S0632|A glass of water.
S0633|A large glass of water would be fine.
S0634|I'd like one of those.
S0635|That is Jane's bag.
S0636|I think that that is Jane's bag.
S0637|Where is her bag?
S0638|I'm trying to think.
S0639|with you sir
S0640|It's the red one.
S0641|I think that it's the red one on that chair.
S0642|how do you feel madam?
S0643|Do you want sir
S0644|Could you say that sir?
S0645|I can help you madam
S0646|You're doing something sir.
S0647|You speak it madam
S0648|what you said madam
S0649|Are you ready sir?
S0650|Do you want to go madam?
S0651|What do you think madam?
S0652|What do you need sir?
S0653|Do you mind madam?
S0654|I'm not sure if I can help you, sir.
S0655|I think that you're doing very well, madam.
S0656|with you all
S0657|how do you all feel?
S0658|Do you all want?
S0659|Could you all say that
S0660|I can help you all
S0661|you're all doing something
S0662|you all speak it
S0663|what you all said
S0664|Are you all ready?
S0665|Do you all want to go?
S0666|What do you all think?
S0667|Do you all mind?
S0668|I hope you'll all be able to go
