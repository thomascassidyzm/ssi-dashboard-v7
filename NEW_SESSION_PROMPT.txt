Generate baskets for S0101-S0668 in 3 sequential batches with 20 parallel agents per batch.

Read the launch plan: PHASE5_BASKET_GENERATION_LAUNCH.md
Read the specification: docs/phase_intelligence/phase_5_conversational_baskets_v3_ACTIVE.md

Execute autonomously overnight:
- Batch 1: S0101-S0300 (200 seeds, 20 agents × 10 seeds)
- Batch 2: S0301-S0500 (200 seeds, 20 agents × 10 seeds)
- Batch 3: S0501-S0668 (168 seeds, adjust distribution)

For each batch:
1. Prepare: Create directories, extract LEGOs, build registry, split into 20 agent files
2. Launch: 20 parallel agents generating 10 baskets per seed
3. Merge: Combine 20 agent outputs
4. Validate: Check GATE, distribution, completeness, naturalness, speakability
5. Fix: Re-run agents for any failed seeds
6. Commit: Push validated batch to remote

Move to next batch ONLY when current batch 100% validated.
