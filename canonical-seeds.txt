475	There are many reasons to consider waiting.
476	I'm waiting for the end of the second half.
477	He's been sick since the second day of the holidays.
478	She has such a kind heart.
479	It's the least I could do.
480	Whatever he says it's not far ahead now.
481	It's the only real hope we have left.
482	The only real hope is that they're not serious.
483	Life isn't easy but it's not meant to be easy.
484	It's meant to be a challenge.
485	Nothing would make me happier than to get away.
486	I think your eyes are beautiful.
487	It's under the bridge.
488	It's on the other side of that yellow line.
489	If you don't make me a strong cup of coffee right now.
490	Then I will never trust anyone ever again.
491	I love the way you try to help.
492	Which of those places do you think is the most interesting?
493	What's going to come next?
494	What happens after the first part of the show?
495	When it matters.
496	I'm not planning to lose when it really matters.
497	That sounds as though you need to get some sleep.
498	He's standing alone over there inside the entrance.
499	Maybe we should open the door and close the window.
500	Why don't you want to sit between the two girls?
501	If only I could trust you to play together without arguing.
502	She almost got lost because she turned left instead of right.
503	I hate making trouble but that one's mine.
504	I'm going to run across the grass.
505	So that I don't get left behind.
506	I used to live around here years ago before we moved.
507	We moved to the city.
508	There's no point worrying about how you're going to pay.
509	I heard that you're going to pay for a new bed.
510	She's gone to look for somewhere safe to park the car.
511	The news took several hours to reach everyone in the office.
512	Can you hold the door open while I fetch the keys?
513	It hurts most when I move my head up and down.
514	I found the perfect house on the first day.
515	On the first day of the new year.
516	They both came on their own.
517	But they left with each other.
518	I couldn't imagine myself having exactly the same problem.
519	I haven't seen their new baby yet.
520	It might have happened to the whole family.
521	I'm afraid that you'll forget why we needed to stay here.
522	Let's agree that it was stupid to tell the truth.
523	Instead of giving an excuse.
524	I'll call you back in three or four minutes.
525	To check if you've been able to finish.
526	I'm finding it hard to believe that you can't guess.
527	Guess who told me that funny story.
528	I'm probably supposed to keep those things in another room.
529	Can you all put your hands up?
530	So I can count them
531	It isn't true that anyone can win the game.
532	Unless they're lucky.
533	She won't listen to every word you say.
534	Let's not go outside in this dreadful weather.
535	He made a promise that he wouldn't choose the wrong job.
536	I used to think that being crazy was bad.
537	But I was wrong.
538	I don't want to seem as though I don't care.
539	But it's getting late.
540	I don't mind if you want to leave without the car.
541	It's a good idea to try and breathe slowly.
542	Whenever you feel angry.
543	She was right.
544	Whoever said it would be difficult was absolutely right.
545	It's your turn to take the clean clothes upstairs.
546	The dog is dirty and wet.
547	Because he has been playing in the mud.
548	I am feeling sad at the moment.
549	Because I have got to be quiet.
550	The end of the village.
551	The church is ugly.
552	The church at the other end of the village is ugly.
553	I think the small church is very ugly.
554	This towel isn't dry.
555	And I'm too tired to fetch a new one.
556	They play music late at night.
557	I wish they wouldn't play such loud music.
558	It's so late at night.
559	Have you found the path through the wood?
560	It goes down to the beach
561	I don't care if it's a fast car.
562	I just want to get there safely.
563	I wouldn't have been able to keep going any longer.
564	I wouldn't have been able to without your help.
565	I'd have thought about it more carefully.
566	I'd have thought more if it had been my choice.
567	It's been lovely spending time outdoors watching the children play.
568	I'm expecting to see an improvement next time we meet.
569	Have you decided how much you are willing to pay?
570	How much are you willing to pay for your ticket?
571	I'm not convinced that would be a very good idea.
572	Have you forgotten what happened the last time they visited us?
573	It's the kind of thing that makes the holidays very special.
574	The holidays are very special for everyone.
575	It's been upsetting.
576	It has been very upsetting waiting.
577	We've been waiting for the news from the hospital.
578	Somewhere warmer.
579	We've often tried.
580	We've often wanted to take the children somewhere a little warmer.
581	He'd like to know a little more about what it's like.
582	What's it like to grow up here?
583	What's it like in this part of the world?
584	What's it like to wake up every morning and see the mountains?
585	I can see the mountains out of my bedroom window.
586	I want twenty boiled eggs.
587	She used to insist that we had eggs for supper.
588	So I wanted to grow up and leave home.
589	She told me she'd just seen the last bus.
590	I saw the last bus leaving the station.
591	She followed me down to the shops.
592	And along the main road.
593	However much I argued I still had to share.
594	I had to share my toys with my sister.
595	I need to lie down in the garden.
596	And I need to close my eyes for a while.
597	I suspect that he's heard a hundred stories about it.
598	He's heard a thousand stories about what they were doing.
599	I'd have been happy to drive if you'd told me.
600	I'd have driven if you'd told me how tired you were.
601	We were talking about how it all started.
602	How it started in the first place.
603	We didn't have anywhere to live at the time.
604	She offered to let us stay with her.
605	Because we needed help.
606	If I'd known then what I know now I'd have waited.
607	If I'd known I'd have done things differently.
608	It would have been the sensible thing to do.
609	The sensible thing to do would have been to ask.
610	He needs to look for work.
611	I would have been ready to look somewhere else.
612	We would have bought something.
613	We probably would have bought a house there.
614	It's near where your family live.
615	I thought you were very brave to say that.
616	You were very brave to say you thought that.
617	You thought that it was a mistake.
618	It doesn't feel like a long time.
619	It's a long time since we saw each other.
620	It's a very long time since we last saw each other.
621	I wouldn't have dared to tell her that it was broken.
622	I knew that the children had broken it.
623	Do you want a cup of coffee or tea?
624	Yes, that would be great, please.
625	Do you want something to drink?
626	No, I'm not thirsty, thank you.
627	Your coffee is ready.
628	Do you like tea?
629	I like it with milk but without sugar.
630	Can I have something to drink please?
631	What would you like?
632	A glass of water.
633	A large glass of water would be fine.
634	I'd like one of those.
635	That is Jane's bag.
636	I think that that is Jane's bag.
637	Where is her bag?
638	I'm trying to think.
639	with you sir
640	It's the red one.
641	I think that it's the red one on that chair.
642	how do you feel madam?
643	Do you want sir
644	Could you say that sir?
645	I can help you madam
646	You're doing something sir.
647	You speak it madam
648	what you said madam
649	Are you ready sir?
650	Do you want to go madam?
651	What do you think madam?
652	What do you need sir?
653	Do you mind madam?
654	I'm not sure if I can help you, sir.
655	I think that you're doing very well, madam.
656	with you all
657	how do you all feel?
658	Do you all want?
659	Could you all say that
660	I can help you all
661	you're all doing something
662	you all speak it
663	what you all said
664	Are you all ready?
665	Do you all want to go?
666	What do you all think?
667	Do you all mind?
668	I hope you'll all be able to go
