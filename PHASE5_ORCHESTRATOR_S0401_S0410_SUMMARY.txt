QUALITY METRICS
================================================================================
✓ Distribution: 100% compliance with 2-2-2-4 (10 phrases per LEGO)
✓ Final LEGOs: All marked correctly with complete seed sentences
✓ Vocabulary: All phrases use available vocabulary from:
  - Recent context (10 previous seeds)
  - Current seed's earlier LEGOs
  - Current LEGO being taught
✓ Phrase Variety: Natural progression from 1 LEGO to 5+ LEGOs
✓ Language Quality: Both English and Chinese phrases are natural and meaningful

PROCESSING APPROACH
================================================================================
The Phase 5 Basket Generation v7.0 methodology was applied systematically:

1. Vocabulary Source Management:
   - Extracted available Chinese vocabulary from recent context
   - Tracked incremental availability of earlier LEGOs within each seed
   - Ensured GATE compliance (zero new vocabulary introduced)

2. Phrase Generation:
   - For each LEGO, generated 10 meaningful practice phrases
   - Maintained 2-2-2-4 distribution:
     * 2 simple phrases (1-2 LEGOs)
     * 2 medium phrases (3 LEGOs)
     * 2 longer phrases (4 LEGOs)
     * 4 complex phrases (5+ LEGOs)

3. Final LEGO Rule:
   - All final LEGOs (#10 phrase) contain the complete seed sentence
   - Ensures learners can practice the full target sentence
