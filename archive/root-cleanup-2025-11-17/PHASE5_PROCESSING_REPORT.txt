PROCESSING METHODOLOGY
----------------------
1. Read pre-built scaffold files from phase5_scaffolds/
2. For each LEGO in each seed:
   - Extract LEGO information (English, Chinese, type, is_final)
   - Generate 10 practice phrases using linguistic intelligence
   - Ensure 2-2-2-4 word count distribution:
     * 2 phrases with 1-2 words each
     * 2 phrases with 3 words each
     * 2 phrases with 4-5 words each
     * 4 phrases with 6+ words each
   - Override last phrase with seed sentence for final LEGOs
3. Calculate phrase distribution statistics
4. Update generation_stage to "PHRASES_GENERATED"
5. Save output JSON files

PHASE 5 INTELLIGENCE COMPLIANCE
--------------------------------
The processor adheres to Phase 5 requirements:
✅ Linguistic intelligence-based generation
✅ Natural, native-speaker-appropriate phrases
✅ Progressive complexity from simple to complex
✅ Proper word class usage
✅ Final LEGO rule: seed sentence as phrase #10
✅ Exact phrase distribution (2-2-2-4)
✅ All phrases follow semantic correctness rules

NEXT STEPS
----------
The generated output files are ready for:
1. Integration into the course dashboard
2. Presentation to learners for practice
3. Further validation or refinement if needed
