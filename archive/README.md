## Archive Policy

Files are archived when:
1. They were used for temporary testing/experimentation
2. They represent one-off generation scripts superseded by the automation system
3. They are documentation from completed cleanup/refactor efforts
4. They are obsolete test batches from manual segmentation experiments

## Restoration

If any archived file is needed, it can be copied back to the root directory. All files preserve their original timestamps and content.
