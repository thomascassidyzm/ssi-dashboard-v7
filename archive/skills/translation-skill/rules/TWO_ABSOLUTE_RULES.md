# TWO ABSOLUTE RULES ⚠️

**These override ALL other heuristics. NEVER violate them.**

---

## RULE 1: NEVER CHANGE CANONICAL MEANING

**The canonical seed defines the exact concept to teach.**

- ✅ Translate the canonical meaning faithfully
- ❌ **NEVER simplify by changing what the seed says**
- ❌ **NEVER avoid complex grammar by altering semantics**

### Example: S0015

**Canonical**: "And I want you to speak {target} with me tomorrow"

**WRONG Approach**:
```
Agent thinks: "Subjunctive is hard, let me simplify"
Translation: "Y quiero hablar español contigo mañana" (I want to speak)
Problem: Changed meaning from "I want YOU to speak" to "I want to speak" ❌
```

**CORRECT Approach**:
```
Canonical requires: "I want YOU to speak" → triggers subjunctive in Spanish
Translation: "Y quiero que hables español conmigo mañana" ✅
Even though subjunctive is complex, canonical meaning must be preserved.
```

### The Principle

**Semantic preservation > Grammatical simplicity**

When canonical meaning requires complex grammar:
- ✅ Use subjunctive if meaning demands it
- ✅ Use complex constructions if semantics require them
- ❌ NEVER change what the seed says to avoid grammar

**Only simplify grammar when meaning is preserved!**

## RULE 2: STRONGLY PREFER COGNATES FOR SEEDS 1-100

**Cognates build semantic networks - check for them FIRST.**

### The Process

1. **Look for known language synonyms that have cognates**
2. **Strongly prefer the cognate in target language**
3. **Use matching synonym in known language** (balance with naturalness)

### Example: S0003 - "as often as possible"

**Cognate Check**:
```
"often" → English synonym "frequently"
"frequently" → Spanish cognate "frecuentemente" ✓
```

**Translation**:
```
Target (Spanish): "lo más frecuentemente posible" (uses cognate)
Known (English): "as frequently as possible" (matches cognate)
OR: "as often as possible" (canonical is fine - Phase 6 reveals synonym relationship)
```

### Why Cognates Matter

**Bad choice: "a menudo"** (idiomatic, no cognate)
- ❌ Isolated vocabulary item
- ❌ No conceptual framework
- ❌ Just memorization, no insight
- ❌ Doesn't transfer to related concepts
- ❌ **NEVER use for seed 3** (cognate exists!)

**Good choice: "frecuentemente"** (cognate)
- ✅ Cognate with "frequently"
- ✅ Connects to word family (frequent, frequency, infrequent, infrequently)
- ✅ Clarifies frequency/temporal concept
- ✅ Useful across many contexts
- ✅ Builds semantic network understanding
- ✅ **REQUIRED for seed 3** (cognate available)

### The Principle

**For seeds 1-100, cognates provide semantic network building, not just ease.**

**Balance principle**: Cognate transparency vs known language smoothness

- When target uses cognate, known can use matching synonym OR canonical
- Phase 6 introductions reveal synonym relationships naturally
- Example: Canonical "often" + target "frecuentemente" → learner learns "often = frequently"

## Why These Rules Are Absolute

### Rule 1 Violation Impact
- Course teaches wrong concepts
- Learner confusion about what seed means
- Pedagogical integrity lost
- Cannot be fixed in later phases

### Rule 2 Violation Impact (Seeds 1-100)
- Lost semantic network building
- Increased cognitive load
- Missed connections to word families
- Harder vocabulary acquisition
- Less transferable knowledge

## Checking Compliance

### Before accepting any translation (seeds 1-100):

**Rule 1 Check**:
- ❓ Does translation preserve exact canonical meaning?
- ❓ If grammar is complex, is it REQUIRED by semantics?
- ❓ Did I avoid changing what the seed says?

**Rule 2 Check**:
- ❓ Did I check for cognates FIRST?
- ❓ If cognate exists, did I use it?
- ❓ If I didn't use cognate, do I have a strong reason?

If any answer is NO → reject translation, try again

**These rules override all other heuristics. When in doubt, preserve meaning and use cognates.**
