# Cognate Preference (Seeds 1-100)

**MANDATORY for seeds 1-100. Always check cognates FIRST.**

---

## What Are Cognates?

Words in different languages with shared etymology and similar meaning:
- English "frequently" ↔ Spanish "frecuentemente"
- English "important" ↔ French "important"
- English "practice" ↔ Italian "praticare"

---

## The Cognate-First Process

### Step 1: Check if cognate exists in target language

```
Seed 3: "as often as possible"

Question: Is there a cognate for "often"?
- "often" → no direct cognate
- BUT: English synonym "frequently" → Spanish "frecuentemente" ✓

Answer: YES, cognate available via synonym
```

### Step 2: Use cognate in target language

```
Target (Spanish): "lo más frecuentemente posible"
```

### Step 3: Match cognate in known language (if needed)

```
Known (English): Can use canonical "as often as possible" OR synonym "as frequently as possible"
- Both work! Phase 6 introductions will reveal "frecuentemente means frequently"
- Learner bridges: often = frequently
```

## Why Cognates Build Semantic Networks

### Example: "frecuentemente" (frequently)

**Isolated word "a menudo"**:
- Learner memorizes: "a menudo" = "often"
- No connections
- No transferable insight

**Cognate "frecuentemente"**:
- Learner recognizes: "frecuent..." = "frequent..."
- Connects to word family:
  - frequent (adjective)
  - frequency (noun)
  - infrequent (adjective)
  - infrequently (adverb)
- Understands temporal/frequency dimension
- Transfers to new contexts
- Requires ~0.1 cognitive units (recognition, not memorization)

**Semantic network value**: 5x more connections than isolated vocabulary

## Cognate Examples by Language

### Spanish for English

**Priority: Cognate > Idiomatic**

- ✅ "frecuentemente" (frequently) > "a menudo" (often)
- ✅ "intentar" (intent/intend) > "tratar" (try)
- ✅ "practicar" (practice) > "entrenar" (train)
- ✅ "importante" (important) > "relevante" (relevant)
- ✅ "utilizar" (utilize) > "usar" (use)
- ✅ "continuar" (continue) > "seguir" (follow/continue)
- ✅ "explicar" (explain) > "aclarar" (clarify)
- ✅ "posible" (possible) > "factible" (feasible)

### French for English

- ✅ "fréquemment" > "souvent"
- ✅ "pratiquer" > "s'entraîner"
- ✅ "important" > "significatif"
- ✅ "utiliser" > "employer"
- ✅ "expliquer" > "clarifier"
- ✅ "continuer" > "poursuivre"

### Italian for English

- ✅ "frequentemente" > "spesso"
- ✅ "importante" > "rilevante"
- ✅ "praticare" > "allenarsi"
- ✅ "utilizzare" > "usare"
- ✅ "continuare" > "proseguire"

### Mandarin for English

**No cognates available** → Use SIMPLEST high-frequency construction instead:
- ✅ Single character > two-character compounds when possible
- ✅ 说 (shuō - speak) > 讲话 (jiǎnghuà - speak)
- ✅ 学 (xué - learn) > 学习 (xuéxí - study)

---

## When Cognate Doesn't Exist

**Fallback strategy** (Mandarin, or no cognate available):
1. Use simplest construction
2. Prefer high-frequency vocabulary
3. Aim for transparency in known language

**Example**: Mandarin "as often as possible"
```
No cognate available between English and Mandarin

Translation: "尽可能经常" (jǐnkěnéng jīngcháng)
- 尽可能 = as...as possible (common pattern)
- 经常 = often (high-frequency, simple)
```

---

## Synonym Flexibility Principle

**Known language can use synonyms to match cognates:**

```
Canonical: "as often as possible"
Target: "lo más frecuentemente posible" (cognate "frecuentemente")
Known: "as frequently as possible" (matches cognate)

Why this works:
- Learner is fluent in known language
- Recognizing synonym variation requires ~0.1 cognitive units
- All cognitive load goes to target language
- Phase 6 reveals: "frecuentemente means frequently"
- Learner bridges: often = frequently (teaches synonym relationship!)
```

**Balance**: Cognate transparency vs known language naturalness

- When known is English: Can use canonical directly (already optimal)
- When known is non-English: Match cognate if possible

---

## Checking Cognate Preference

**Before accepting any translation (seeds 1-100):**

1. ❓ Did I check for cognate FIRST?
2. ❓ Does a cognate exist (direct or via synonym)?
3. ❓ If YES: Did I use it?
4. ❓ If NO: Do I have a strong reason not to?

**Strong reasons NOT to use cognate**:
- Cognate is archaic/rare in target language
- Cognate has different meaning (false friend)
- No cognate exists for this language pair

**Weak reasons (NOT acceptable)**:
- ❌ "Idiomatic sounds more natural"
- ❌ "Native speakers use different word"
- ❌ "I prefer this other word"

**For seeds 1-100, cognate preference is mandatory when cognates exist.**

## Impact on Learning

### Without Cognate Preference (Using Idioms)

```
Seed 3: "a menudo" (often)
Seed 7: "intentar" (to try - cognate happened to be used)
Seed 9: "un poco" (a little)

Learner experience:
- Memorize each word individually
- No patterns, no connections
- High cognitive load
- Slow vocabulary growth
```

### With Cognate Preference

```
Seed 3: "frecuentemente" (frequently - cognate)
Seed 7: "intentar" (to try/intend - cognate)
Seed 9: "un poco de" (a little of - transparent)

Learner experience:
- Recognize cognate patterns
- Build word family networks
- Low cognitive load (recognition > memorization)
- Fast vocabulary growth
- Transferable understanding
```

**Result**: 3-5x faster vocabulary acquisition with cognate preference

**For seeds 1-100: Check cognates FIRST. Use them when they exist. Build semantic networks.**
