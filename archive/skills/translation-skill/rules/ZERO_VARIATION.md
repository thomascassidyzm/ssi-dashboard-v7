# Zero Variation Principle (Seeds 1-100)

**One concept in known language = ONE translation in target language**

---

## The Core Rule

**"First Word Wins" - Once you establish a mapping, stick with it.**

```
First occurrence of concept → Choose BEST cognate
Record in vocabulary registry
ALL future occurrences → Use SAME word (no variation)
```

---

## Why Zero Variation Works

### The Problem: Variation Creates Decision Paralysis

**With variation (BAD)**:
```
Seed 2: "tratando" = trying
Seed 7: "intentar" = to try
Seed 8: "tratar" = to try

Learner's brain: "Which word should I use for 'try'?"
- Decision paralysis
- Cognitive load wasted on word choice
- Not speaking fluently
```

### The Solution: Zero Variation Creates Automaticity

**Without variation (GOOD)**:
```
Seed 2: "intentando" = trying (CLAIM: "intentar" for all "try" contexts)
Seed 7: "intentar" = to try
Seed 8: "intentar" = to try

Learner's brain: "'intentar' IS the word for try!"
- No decisions needed
- Automatic retrieval
- Speaking fluently from day one
```

---

## The Vocabulary Registry

**Maintain an internal registry as you translate:**

```
VOCABULARY REGISTRY (build during translation):
- "to speak" → "hablar" (claimed in S0001)
- "to want" → "querer" (claimed in S0001)
- "to try" → "intentar" (claimed in S0002)
- "to learn" → "aprender" (claimed in S0002)
- "often/frequently" → "frecuentemente" (claimed in S0003)
- "to practice" → "practicar" (claimed in S0005)
- "to remember" → "recordar" (claimed in S0006)
- "to explain" → "explicar" (claimed in S0008)
```

### Registry Rules

1. **When you encounter a new concept:**
   - Check cognate FIRST (mandatory seeds 1-100)
   - Pick BEST cognate
   - Record in registry

2. **When you encounter existing concept:**
   - Check registry
   - Use SAME word
   - Do NOT introduce synonyms

3. **Zero exceptions for seeds 1-100**

## First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Principle

**The first time a concept appears determines its canonical translation.**

### Example: "to try"

```
SEED 2: "I'm trying to learn"

Cognate check:
- "try" → English has "intent/intend"
- "intend" → Spanish "intentar" ✓

Decision: "to try" → "intentar" (cognate chosen)
Registry: Record "try" → "intentar"

This locks in "intentar" for ALL occurrences across entire course
```

**All future seeds must use "intentar":**
```
SEED 7: "I want to try as hard as I can"
Translation: "Quiero intentar tan duro como pueda"

SEED 15: "I'm trying to remember"
Translation: "Estoy intentando recordar"

SEED 50, 150, 300: Must ALL use "intentar"
NEVER: "tratar", "procurar", etc. in seeds 1-100
```

---

## Common FCFS Violations (NEVER DO THIS)

### Violation Example 1: Synonym Introduction

❌ **BAD**:
```
SEED 2: "tratando de aprender" (trying to learn)
SEED 7: "intentar tan duro" (to try as hard)

Problem: Two words for same concept → learner confused
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```
SEED 2: "intentando aprender" (trying to learn)
SEED 7: "intentar tan duro" (to try as hard)

Result: One word for concept → learner confident
```

### Violation Example 2: "More Natural" Alternative

❌ **BAD**:
```
SEED 3: "lo más frecuentemente posible" (cognate used)
SEED 50: "tan a menudo como pueda" (switched to idiomatic)

Problem: Variation breaks automaticity
```

✅ **GOOD**:
```
SEED 3: "lo más frecuentemente posible" (cognate used)
SEED 50: "lo más frecuentemente posible" (same word)

Result: Consistent, automatic retrieval
```

---

## Exception: Grammatically Required Variation

**Some variation is unavoidable when grammar requires it:**

### Spanish: "ser" vs "estar" (both "to be")

```
Context determines which:
- "ser" = permanent/identity ("Soy profesor" - I am a teacher)
- "estar" = temporary/state ("Estoy cansado" - I am tired)

Solution:
- Introduce BOTH early
- Choose consistently based on context
- Document pattern in registry:
  - "to be" (permanent) → "ser"
  - "to be" (temporary) → "estar"
```

### French: "savoir" vs "connaître" (both "to know")

```
Context determines which:
- "savoir" = know facts ("Je sais la réponse" - I know the answer)
- "connaître" = know people/places ("Je connais Marie" - I know Marie)

Solution:
- Introduce BOTH early
- Choose consistently based on context
- Document pattern in registry
```

**These are grammatical requirements, not semantic variation. They're exceptions.**

---

## Progressive Variation (After Seed 100)

### Seeds 1-100: ZERO variation
- One concept = one word
- Build automaticity

### Seeds 101-300: Introduce natural alternatives
- Still prefer established words
- Gradually show alternatives with distinct contexts

### Seeds 301-668: Full natural/idiomatic variation
- Use most natural word for each context
- Variation encouraged

**Example progression**:
```
SEEDS 1-100: Only "hablar" for all speaking contexts
SEEDS 101-300: Introduce "decir" for "to say" (distinct meaning)
SEEDS 301+: Full range: "hablar", "decir", "contar", "charlar", etc.
```

---

## Impact on Learning

### Without Zero Variation

```
Cognitive load per concept: 3-5 decision points
- "Which synonym should I use?"
- "Is this context right for this word?"
- "Will I sound natural?"

Result: Slow, hesitant speech
```

### With Zero Variation (Seeds 1-100)

```
Cognitive load per concept: 0 decision points
- "There's only one word for this"
- Automatic retrieval
- Confident production

Result: Fluent, confident speech from day one
```

**After automaticity is built (seed 100+), variation can be introduced gradually.**

---

## Checking Zero Variation Compliance

**Before accepting any translation:**

1. ❓ Have I seen this concept before?
2. ❓ If YES: Am I using the SAME word from registry?
3. ❓ If NO: Did I choose the best cognate and record it?
4. ❓ Am I introducing variation to sound "more natural"?

If answer to #4 is YES → **STOP. Use registry word instead.**

**For seeds 1-100: Consistency > Naturalness. Always.**

---

## Vocabulary Registry Management

### During Translation

**For each seed:**
```
1. Identify all concepts in the seed
2. Check each concept against registry
3. If concept exists → use registry word
4. If concept is new → choose best cognate, add to registry
5. Translate using registry words
```

### Extended Thinking Integration

```
<thinking>
Seed S0015: "I'm trying to remember"

Concepts present:
- "trying" → Check registry: "intentar" (from S0002) ✓
- "to remember" → Check registry: "recordar" (from S0006) ✓

Decision: Use registry words for consistency
Translation: "Estoy intentando recordar"
</thinking>
```

**Registry checking must be part of every translation's extended thinking.**

---

**Core Principle: First Word Wins. For seeds 1-100, zero variation builds automaticity.**
